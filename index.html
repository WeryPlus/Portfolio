    <h3> Who is WeryPlus? </h3>
    <p> WeryPlus is the tag I created when I was a child as a name just like "on of those YouTuber's name" and that with
        time I started using it as my Dev nickname as a tribute to the memories I have of enjoying games as a kid and to
        my little brother who helped me chose it at that time. </p>

    <h3> KotonHunt (VR) </h3>
    <section class="twoColumns">
        <section class="textColumn">
            <p> KotonHunt is what I consider my first real game, which I created for my <b>Accessibility & Augmented
                Reality</b> class with University of Oviedo. </p>
            <p> This game is a story-based game, which drives you through the story of an ancient village which was
                corrupted by evil. The mission of the player is to obtain the position of every one of the hidden
                piggies, which can be obtained after completing a puzzle. </p>
            <p> This game was created as an experiment with VR on android mobiles, where I tried to create an interesting
                game to play, while being able to show my capabilities with everything I learned from the course. </p>
            <p> Created with Unity for Android (VR) - 24 of October 2021. </p>

    <h3> KotonHunt: The Card Game (AR) </h3>
    <section class="twoColumns">
        <section class="textColumn">
            <p> KotonHunt: The Card Game was born with the idea of adapting the experience of playing KotonHunt to the
                real life by using your mobile phone. It was once again created for my AR course. </p>
            <p> This game is a simple android app that has a very colourful menu with images from the original KotonHunt
                game. </p>
            <p> This game was created as a way of learning how android apps work and more specifically AR ones. This is
                actually the first time I worked with the Unity's GUI system, and I was able to experiment with data
                storage between sessions. </p>
            <p> Created with Unity for Android (AR) - 12 of January 2022. </p>

    <h3> Cheescape (Oculus VR) </h3>
    <section class="twoColumns">
        <section class="textColumn">
            <p> Cheescape is probably the game I am most proud of making so far. This app was created in a group project
                in which I played the role of coordinator/lead-developer. We were six people and each one of us designed
                and programmed our own room. </p>
            <p> This game is a story-based puzzle game which resembles the typical escape room. The story shows you
                images from the past that follow the path of a mice that once walked the path in front of you. The main
                goal of the game is to have the player immersed in the story while trying to think how to get to the
                next room. </p>
            <p> This game was created as a way of testing the developer options given by Oculus. While we encountered a
                lot of problems and spent a lot of time working on putting it all together the feeling of having a final
                30-min game was amazing for us. We might upload the game to the Oculus Store shortly. </p>
            <p> Created with Unity for Oculus - 13 of January 2022. </p>
