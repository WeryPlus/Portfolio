        <h3> Who is WeryPlus? </h3>
            <p> WeryPlus is the tag I created when I was a child as a name just like "on of those YouTuber's name" and that with time I started using it as my Dev nickname as a tribute to the memories I have of enjoying games as a kid and to my little brother who helped me chose it at that time. </p>

        <h3> KotonHunt (VR) </h3>
            <section class="twoColumns">
                <section>
                    <p> KotonHunt is what I consider my first real game, which I created for my <b>Accesibility & Augmented Reality</b> class with University of Oviedo. </p>
                    <p> This game is a story-based game, which drives you through the story of an ancient village which was corrupted by evil. The mission of the player is to obtain the position of every one of the hidden piggies, which can be obtained after completing a puzzle. </p>
                    <p> This game was created as a experiment with VR on android mobiles, where I tried to create an interesting game to play, while being able to show my capabilities with everything I learned from the course. </p>
                    <p> Created with Unity for Android (VR) - 24 of October, 2021. </p>

        <h3> KotonHunt: The Card Game (AR) </h3>
            <section class="twoColumns">
                <section>
                    <p> KotonHunt: The Card Game was born with the idea of adapting the experience of playing KotonHunt to the real life by using your mobile phone. It was once again created for my AR course. </p>
                    <p> This game is a simple android app that has a very colourful menu with images from the original KotonHunt game. </p>
                    <p> This game was created as a way of learning how android apps work and more specifically AR ones. This is actually the first time I worked with the Unity's GUI system and I was able to experiment with data storage between sessions. </p>
                    <p> Created with Unity for Android (AR) - 12 of January, 2022. </p>

        <h3> Cheescape (Oculur VR) </h3>
            <section class="twoColumns">
                <section>
                    <p> Cheescape is probably the game I am most proud of making so far. This app was created in a group project in which I played the role of coordinator/lead-developer. We were six people and each one of us designed and programmed our own room. </p>
                    <p> This game is a story-based puzzle game which resembles the typical escape room. The story shows you images from the past that follow the path of a mice that once walked the path in front of you. The main goal of the game is to have the player immersed in the story while trying to think how to get to the next room. </p>
                    <p> This game was createdas a way of testing the developer options given by Oculus. While we encountered a lot of problems and spent a lot of time working on putting it all together the feeling of having a final 30 min game was amazing for us. We might upload the game to the Oculus Store shortly. </p>
                    <p> Created with Unity for Oculus - 13 of January, 2022. </p>
